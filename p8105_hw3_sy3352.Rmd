# Problem 1

The `instacart` data set contains data of order details people placed on instacart in 2017. It contains `r nrow(instacart)` observations and `r ncol(instacart)` columns. Each row gives detailed information of one product in an order. Some of the key variables are `order_id` `product_id` `reordered` `order_dow` `order_hour_of_day` `product_name` `aisle` and `department`. For example, row 3859 displayed an **Organic Baby Carrots**
 ordered by userid **198041** on Saturday afternoon (`order_dow`: 6 and `order_hour_of_day`: 18), which belongs to aisle **packaged vegetables fruits** and department **produce**.
