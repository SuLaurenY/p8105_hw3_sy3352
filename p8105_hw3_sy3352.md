# Problem 1

The `instacart` data set contains data of order details people placed on
instacart in 2017. It contains 1384617 observations and 15 columns. Each
row gives detailed information of one product in an order. Some of the
key variables are `order_id` `product_id` `reordered` `order_dow`
`order_hour_of_day` `product_name` `aisle` and `department`. For
example, row 3859 displayed an **Organic Baby Carrots** ordered by
userid **198041** on Saturday afternoon (`order_dow`: 6 and
`order_hour_of_day`: 18), which belongs to aisle **packaged vegetables
fruits** and department **produce**.

``` r
aisle_amount = count(instacart, aisle, sort = TRUE)
aisle_amount
```

There are 134 aisles. The most ordered aisles are `fresh vegetables`,
`fresh fruits`, `packaged vegetables fruits`, `yogurt` and
`packaged cheese`.

47 zip codes are observed 116 times. 26 zip codes are observed less than
10 times. Possible reasons for some zip codes to be observed fewer than
others can be that they are commercial zip codes or PO-box zip codes
which does not represent residential significance and thus does not
provide consistent rent information. For example, the zip code **10044**
was observed 9 times. It stands for Roosevelt island which has a small
area and thus less housing for rent, resulting in less rental
information provided.

From the table above, we can see that in general, the rental prices
across all boroughs in NYC increased consistently from year 2015 to year
2024, except in year 2022 when the impact of covid-19 caused on overall
decline in rental pr1ices compared with the previous year. There were no
rental data available for Richmond County until year 2020.  
Among the 5 boroughs that we compare, New York County consistently has
the highest rental prices, and the Bronx County has the lowest.  
Bronx county experienced the fastest rent growth among the 5 boroughs
with its rent in 2024 being **1.39** times higher compared to what’s in
2015. In contrast, Queens has the slowest rent growth with a **1.22**
times higher rent in 2024 compared with that in 2015.

The 5 boroughs in the plot are represented by 5 different colors as
shown in the legend at the bottom. Each point in the plot represents a
zip code’s rent in a certain year. From the plot we can see overall all
5 boroughs in NYC experience a steady growth (except for 2020-2021 due
to covid-19 impact) in rent and also a more and more spread-out price
range. Richmond County has no data available during 2015 to 2019, thus
the points only starts from 2020. New York County has not only overall
highest rent but also the widest range of rents, indicating the most
diversity in housing rental options.

The plot shows the rent price of each zip code in NYC by month of 2023.
The 5 boroughs in the plot are represented by 5 different colors as
shown in the legend at the bottom. Each violin in the plot represents
the allocation of rental price of zip codes in each month. From the plot
we can see overall all 5 boroughs in NYC has a stable retal price
throughout the year, with a very slight steady growth towards the end of
the year. New York County has not only overall highest rent but also the
widest range of rents, indicating the most diversity in housing rental
options. Bronx and Richmond County has relatively low rent but also the
most tightly clustered rent distribution, indicating that housing
options in these boroughs are relatively uniformed.
