# Problem 1

The `instacart` data set contains data of order details people placed on
instacart in 2017. It contains 1384617 observations and 15 columns. Each
row gives detailed information of one product in an order. Some of the
key variables are `order_id` `product_id` `reordered` `order_dow`
`order_hour_of_day` `product_name` `aisle` and `department`. For
example, row 3859 displayed an **Organic Baby Carrots** ordered by
userid **198041** on Saturday afternoon (`order_dow`: 6 and
`order_hour_of_day`: 18), which belongs to aisle **packaged vegetables
fruits** and department **produce**.
